I use the CA crt both clients and server as follows

1. Generate Certificates

First, you'll need to generate certificates for both the server and the client. If you don't have a certificate authority (CA), you can create a self-signed CA to sign the server and client certificates.
Generate the CA Certificate:

# Generate CA private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out ca.key

# Generate CA certificate
openssl req -x509 -key ca.key -out ca.crt -days 365 -subj "/CN=MyCA"

Generate the Server Certificate:

# Generate server private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out server.key

# Create server certificate signing request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -subj "/CN=localhost"

# Sign the server CSR with the CA certificate
openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out server.crt -days 365

Generate the Client Certificate:

# Generate client private key
openssl genpkey -algorithm RSA -out client.key

# Create client certificate signing request (CSR)
openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr -subj "/CN=client"

# Sign the client CSR with the CA certificate
openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial -out client.crt -days 365


```
where exactly in http request, those certificates send by client send? it is not in body, not in header, but where In protocol https? or TCP?
```

ChatGPT said:
Client certificates in an mTLS (mutual TLS) handshake are not sent in the HTTP body or headers. Instead, they are exchanged at the TLS/SSL layer, which is part of the transport protocol (TCP), during the TLS handshake process. This occurs before any HTTP request or response is sent.

Hereâ€™s where and how client certificates are sent:
1. The HTTPS/TLS Layer

TLS operates on top of TCP and handles encryption, authentication, and data integrity. During an mTLS handshake, the following steps occur:

    Server Authentication (Standard TLS):
    The server presents its certificate to the client to prove its identity. This is what happens in traditional one-way TLS (used for HTTPS).

    Client Authentication (mTLS):
    If mTLS is enabled, the server requests the client's certificate. The client sends its certificate during the handshake.

This process happens before the HTTP protocol starts. The certificates are exchanged as part of the TLS handshake messages.
2. In the TLS Handshake

The exchange of client certificates specifically happens during the Certificate and CertificateVerify messages:

    Server Requests Client Certificate:
    The server sends a CertificateRequest message as part of the TLS handshake to indicate that the client must provide a certificate.

    Client Sends Certificate:
    The client responds with its certificate in the Certificate message. This includes the client's certificate chain.

    Certificate Validation:
    The server validates the certificate against its trusted CA store. If valid, the handshake continues.

These messages are defined in the TLS protocol and are transmitted over the established TCP connection.
3. At the TCP Layer

At the TCP layer, the client certificate is just part of the binary data exchanged as part of the TLS protocol. This data is transmitted within the encrypted TCP stream and is not visible to higher-level protocols like HTTP.
4. Summary of Layers
Layer	What Happens
HTTP	Client sends HTTP requests, but certificates aren't sent here.
TLS/SSL	Client and server exchange certificates during handshake.
TCP	Binary TLS handshake data (including certificates) is sent.
Network	Underlying transport mechanism for TCP packets.
Why Certificates Are Not in HTTP

Certificates are sent as part of the transport security protocol (TLS) because:

    Separation of Concerns: TLS secures the connection independently of the application-layer protocol (e.g., HTTP).
    Encryption and Privacy: Certificates are exchanged before any application data is sent, ensuring the entire session is encrypted.

Conclusion

The client certificates in mTLS are sent during the TLS handshake phase, which happens at the transport layer (TCP) and is managed by the TLS protocol. This exchange occurs independently of the HTTP protocol, ensuring that all HTTP traffic is securely encrypted once the TLS session is established.
